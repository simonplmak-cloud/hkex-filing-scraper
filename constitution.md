> Impact Chain: Phase 0 — Constitution (immutable)

## Purpose

Build the most useful, feature-rich, and trustworthy open-source tool in the HKEx regulatory filings data category. The tool scrapes HKEx regulatory filings via an undocumented JSON API and ingests them into **one or more configured database sinks** — SurrealDB (primary, graph-capable) and PostgreSQL (optional, relational) — with full-text/tables extraction and optional graph edges, so downstream systems can process a complete, faithful, provenance-preserving corpus from whichever store they already operate.

## Core Principles

### 1. Completeness Over Convenience

Every filing from April 1999 onward must be reachable. Gaps are a bug. Delisted issuers, amendments, attachments, Chinese-language filings, and non-PDF documents (Excel, HTML) are all first-class citizens. Never silently drop records.

### 2. Data Fidelity Over Speed

Extracted text and tables must faithfully represent the source document. Merged cells, reading order, bilingual content, and page structure matter. When fidelity is impossible (scanned PDFs, corrupted files), the tool MUST report extraction status and confidence — never silently produce garbage.

### 3. Reliability Through Resilience

The pipeline must survive network failures, rate limits, endpoint changes, and database errors. Batching, retries with exponential backoff, checksums, idempotent upserts, and stalled-job detection are not optional — they are the baseline.

### 4. Provenance is Non-Negotiable

Every extracted fact, table cell, and graph edge must trace back to the exact filing, document version, and page. No information without origin. This applies equally to AI-generated summaries and raw text extraction, and to every sink the data is written to.

### 5. Developer-First Delivery

The tool must be installable with one command, runnable from CLI, queryable via standard interfaces, and extensible without modifying core. SDKs, MCP tools, and API wrappers are natural extensions — not afterthoughts.

### 6. Observed Behavior Over Assumed Behavior

Configuration is loaded from CWD `.env` — not the project root. SurrealDB `/rpc` parses `word:word` as record links. The HKEx API requires a JSF ViewState round-trip. PostgreSQL `ON CONFLICT` is the idempotency mechanism. These quirks are documented in AGENTS.md, not buried in source comments.

### 7. Schema Stability Must Be Explicit

`exchange_filing` is SCHEMAFULL in SurrealDB, and a typed `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` model in PostgreSQL. Adding a field requires updating the DDL in `db.py:_build_schema_sql()` and the mirror DDL in `db_postgres.py:_build_postgres_schema_sql()`. Migrations run safely at every startup using `IF NOT EXISTS`.

### 8. Progressive Enhancement Over Monolithic Dependencies

Core scraping works with only `requests` + `beautifulsoup4`. PDF extraction (PyMuPDF, pymupdf4llm, camelot-py), Excel parsing (openpyxl), env loading (python-dotenv), and the PostgreSQL driver (`psycopg[binary,pool]`) are optional extras. The tool must function gracefully when optional deps are missing.

### 9. Sink Parity and Explicit Failure

When more than one sink is configured, every record written to one sink MUST be attempted on the other. A failure on any configured sink is logged, counted, and surfaced — never swallowed. The pipeline MUST NOT report success for a record whose configured sink writes did not all succeed.

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Language | Python 3.10+ | Type hints throughout; `from __future__ import annotations` |
| Build | hatchling | src-layout, single console script `hkex-scraper` |
| HTTP | `requests` | base dep, always available |
| HTML parsing | `beautifulsoup4` | base dep, always available |
| Optional PDF | PyMuPDF, pymupdf4llm, camelot-py | guarded by `_AVAILABLE` flags |
| Optional Excel | openpyxl | guarded by `_AVAILABLE` flags |
| Optional env | python-dotenv | graceful fallback if missing |
| Primary database | SurrealDB | `/sql` (1 MiB) + `/rpc` (4 MiB) endpoints |
| Optional database | PostgreSQL 13+ | `psycopg` 3.x (`psycopg[binary,pool]`), `ON CONFLICT` upserts, JSONB for tables |
| Testing | pytest | pure unit tests, no DB/network |
| Lint | ruff | py310 target, line-length 100 |

## Domain Primitives

| Domain Term | Definition |
|-------------|-----------|
| Filing | A single HKEx regulatory disclosure (metadata + one source document) |
| Phase 1 | Scrape filing metadata from the HKEx JSON API |
| Phase 2 | Download documents + extract text/tables into Markdown |
| Chunk | One month-range slice of the search space when no stock code is specified |
| `filingId` | MD5 hash of key fields used for deduplication (primary key in both sinks) |
| `documentStatus` | `processed` / `skipped` / `failed` outcome of document processing |
| Graph edge | `has_filing` (company → filing) or `references_filing` (title mention) |
| Sink | A configured persistence target — `surrealdb`, `postgres`, or both (`DATABASE_TARGET`) |
| Dual-write | Writing the same record to every configured sink within one pipeline phase |

## Security Constraints

1. No hardcoded credentials — all secrets come from environment variables or `.env`.
2. `.env` is loaded from `Path.cwd()`, never the project root; never commit `.env`.
3. Database auth (SurrealDB NS/DB/user/pass, PostgreSQL DSN) is built at runtime from config, never logged.
4. SQL string escaping via `utils.escape_sql()` is mandatory for all SurrealDB `/sql` paths to prevent injection.
5. SurrealDB `/rpc` is preferred for parameterized saves to avoid record-link and injection issues.
6. PostgreSQL statements MUST use bound parameters (`%s` / `%(name)s`) — never string-concatenate values into SQL.
7. Log files (`logs/`) and failed-SQL dumps (`logs/hkex_failed.sql`) must not contain credentials; redact before logging.
8. No execution of remote content — extracted document text is treated as untrusted data, never evaluated.

## Banned Patterns

- Plain `.js` / non-Python source in the package.
- Synchronous blocking HTTP inside the Phase 2 worker pool.
- Silent `except:` clauses — every failure path must log via `utils.log()`.
- Direct `CREATE TABLE` without `IF NOT EXISTS` in schema DDL (SurrealDB or PostgreSQL).
- `documentContent` blob field (obsolete — auto-removed on startup).
- Copy-pasting record-link-interpretation-prone strings into SurrealDB `/rpc` without the `/sql` fallback check.
- Embedding unparameterised values into PostgreSQL SQL.
- Importing `psycopg` at module top level without an `_AVAILABLE` guard.

## File Structure

```
src/hkex_scraper/
  main.py        # CLI parsing, orchestration, validation
  config.py      # env vars + constants (loaded at import from CWD .env)
  api.py         # HKEx JSON API session, chunking, record parsing
  pipeline.py    # Phase 1 metadata save, Phase 2 download/extract/save loop
  extractor.py   # PDF/HTML/Excel text + table extraction → Markdown
  db.py          # SurrealDB /sql + /rpc helpers, schema DDL, batch upsert
  db_postgres.py # PostgreSQL sink: optional driver, DDL, parameterized ON CONFLICT upserts
  graph.py       # has_filing / references_filing edge creation
  utils.py       # logging, string helpers, filing classification, tickers
tests/           # pure unit tests (no DB/network)
```

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| SurrealDB as primary store | Native graph edges, SCHEMAFULL for data integrity, parameterized RPC for large payloads |
| PostgreSQL as optional relational sink | Downstream teams standardise on SQL/Postgres; removes the graph-DB adoption barrier without abandoning it |
| Sink selection via `DATABASE_TARGET` | One env var selects `surrealdb` (default), `postgres`, or both; backward compatible with existing deployments |
| Two-phase pipeline (metadata → documents) | Decouples fast metadata ingestion from slow document processing; enables backfill and incremental updates |
| CLI-first, not GUI-first | Maximizes composability with scripts, cron jobs, and CI/CD pipelines |
| Undocumented JSON API over browser automation | Faster, more reliable batch scraping; no Selenium dependency |
| SurrealDB `/rpc` first with `/sql` fallback | 4x larger body limit for parameterized queries; escape to `/sql` only when record-link bug strikes |
| `filingId` as the shared dedup key across sinks | Same MD5-16 identifier gives cross-sink idempotency and a join key for parity checks |

## Prohibitions

- No production dependency on prohibited scraping (HKEX Terms of Use §4.3). The undocumented API is a research tool. Commercial redistribution requires licensed feed access.
- No silent data loss. Every truncation, skip, or failure must be logged and surfaced via `documentStatus` and `documentStatusReason`, and via per-sink write counters.
- No breaking schema changes without migration. Every new field must have a `DEFINE FIELD IF NOT EXISTS` (SurrealDB) and a matched `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` (PostgreSQL).
- No hardcoded credentials. All secrets come from environment variables or `.env`.
- No required dependency on PostgreSQL. Missing driver or DSN must degrade gracefully, never crash the scrape.
